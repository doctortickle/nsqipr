# About ACS NSQIP<sup>&copy;</sup>

Welcome to `nsqipr`! If you're reading this, you are likely already familiar with the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (**ACS NSQIP**<sup>&copy;</sup>). If not, you can read about it [here](https://www.facs.org/quality-programs/acs-nsqip). The ACS NSQIP <sup>&copy;</sup> is a nationally validated, risk-adjusted, outcomes-based program to measure and improve the quality of surgical care. 

As of `r Sys.Date()`, there are currently [706 hospitals](https://www.facs.org/search/nsqip-participants?allresults=) that participate in and contribute to the program. The entire database contains **more than 6.6 million cases** for data analysis. 

## Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

ACS NSQIP<sup>&copy;</sup> captures and reports 30-day morbidity and mortality outcomes for all major inpatient and outpatient surgical procedures as determined by Current Procedural Terminology (CPT<sup>&copy;</sup>) code. This list is updated annually as new codes become available. Excluded cases are:
  
  * Patients under the age of 18 years.
  * \>3 inguinal herniorrhaphies in an 8-day period.
  * \>3 breast lumpectomies in an 8-day period.
  * \>3 laparoscopic cholecystectomies in an 8-day period.
  * \>3 TURPs and/or TURBTs in an 8-day period.

## Publications

The data from ACS NSQIP<sup>&copy;</sup> is used to produce **approximately 400 publications per year**. As of `r Sys.Date()`, there are currently [2,728 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=nsqip) analyzing the ACS NSQIP<sup>&copy;</sup> database.

# About `nsqipr`

## Purpose

ACS NSQIP<sup>&copy;</sup> requires that members request specific datasets for use in research. The files are then delivered as `.exe` executables avaiable for download from a JavaServer page for a limited duration of time. The archived files can be unzipped and contain a `.txt` tab-delimited file. Some will also contain a PDF version of the Participant Use File (**PUF**); these define the variables in the dataset. The `.txt` tab-delimited file must be read into R as a data frame and meticulously cleaned prior to being used for data analysis. 

The purpose of `nsqipr` is to streamline this process. This package is geared towards those surgical interns, residents, and attendings who have limited experience with `R`, `SQL`, or "big data" analysis. It is also designed to be a useful tool for that experienced researcher or computer scientist making frequent use of ACS NSQIP<sup>&copy;</sup> PUFs.

## Installation

You can install or upgrade `nsqipr` with:

```r
devtools::install_github("doctortickle/nsqipr")
```

We are not (yet) available on CRAN.

## Set-up

`nsqipr` has a few set-up requirements:

### Database

A local or remote database to which you have read/write privileges needs to be available. At the time, only a PostgreSQL server is compatible (recommend PostgreSQL 12). If you currently do not have one available, one can easily and cheaply procured with [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/). 

### .Renviron
The `.Renviron` file should contain the following variables:
  * `NSQIP_DB` - the name of the database
  * `NSQIP_DB_USER` - the database user name
  * `NSQIP_DB_PW` - the database password
  * `NSQIP_DB_DRIVER` - the database driver (see \code{\link[odbc]{odbc}})
  * `NSQIP_DB_PORT` - the database port
  * `NSQIP_DB_HOST` - the host IP address

### External dependencies

`7z` and `psql` must be installed on the host (your) operating system.

`psql` is the standard command line interface for interacting with a PostgreSQL instance. For installation instructions, please refer to [this tutorial](https://blog.timescale.com/tutorials/how-to-install-psql-on-mac-ubuntu-debian-windows/).

`7z` is a file archiver with a high compression ratio format. It is used to unzip the `.exe` executable files delivered by ACS NSQIP<sup>&copy;</sup> upon request. For installation instructions, please refer to [the 7zip website](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html).

## Use

  1. Store all `.exe` executable files from ACS NSQIP<sup>&copy;</sup> in a single directory (do **not** change the default file names). Assign the directory path to `dir`.
  2. Connect to your database instance with `conn <- DBI::dbConnect(...)`.
  3. Now simply run `nsqip(dir, conn)`.
  
`nsqipr` will take care of the unzipping, data importing, and data cleaning. You're now ready to use the ACS NSQIP<sup>&copy;</sup> for data analysis!
