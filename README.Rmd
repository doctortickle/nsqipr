# About ACS NSQIP<sup>&copy;</sup>

Welcome to `nsqipr`! If you're reading this, you are likely already familiar with the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (**ACS NSQIP**<sup>&copy;</sup>). If not, you can read about it [here](https://www.facs.org/quality-programs/acs-nsqip). The ACS NSQIP <sup>&copy;</sup> is a nationally validated, risk-adjusted, outcomes-based program to measure and improve the quality of surgical care. 

As of `r Sys.Date()`, there are currently [706 hospitals](https://www.facs.org/search/nsqip-participants?allresults=) that participate in and contribute to the program. The entire database contains **more than 6.6 million cases** for data analysis. 

## Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

ACS NSQIP<sup>&copy;</sup> captures and reports 30-day morbidity and mortality outcomes for all major inpatient and outpatient surgical procedures as determined by Current Procedural Terminology (CPT<sup>&copy;</sup>) code. This list is updated annually as new codes become available. Excluded cases are:
  
  * Patients under the age of 18 years.
  * \>3 inguinal herniorrhaphies in an 8-day period.
  * \>3 breast lumpectomies in an 8-day period.
  * \>3 laparoscopic cholecystectomies in an 8-day period.
  * \>3 TURPs and/or TURBTs in an 8-day period.

## Publications

The data from ACS NSQIP<sup>&copy;</sup> is used to produce **approximately 400 publications per year**. As of `r Sys.Date()`, there are currently [2,728 publications](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=nsqip) analyzing the ACS NSQIP<sup>&copy;</sup> database.

# About `nsqipr`

## Purpose

ACS NSQIP<sup>&copy;</sup> requires that members request specific datasets for use in research. The files are then delivered as `.exe` executables avaiable for download for a limited duration of time. The archived files can be unzipped and contain a `.txt` tab-delimited file. Some will also contain a PDF version of the Participant Use File (**PUF**); these define the variables in the dataset. The `.txt` tab-delimited file must be read into R as a data frame and meticulously cleaned prior to being used for data analysis. Researchers often want to combine data across multiple years. This complicates data preparation as variables are removed or added every year and sometimes the same variable may be recorded differently in two different years.

The purpose of `nsqipr` is to streamline this process. This package is geared towards those surgical interns, residents, and attendings who have limited experience with `R`, `SQL`, or "big data" analysis. It is also designed to be a useful tool for that experienced researcher or computer scientist making frequent use of ACS NSQIP<sup>&copy;</sup> PUFs.

## Installation

You can install or upgrade `nsqipr` with:

```r
devtools::install_github("dylanrussellmd/nsqipr")
```

We are not (yet) available on CRAN.

## Use

  1. Execute all `.exe` executable files from ACS NSQIP<sup>&copy;</sup> in a single directory (`dir`) (do not change the default file names). 
  2. Now simply run `nsqip(dir)`.
  
`nsqipr` will take care of the rest. You're now ready to use the ACS NSQIP<sup>&copy;</sup> data for data analysis!

## Variables

TODO: Build example table of raw variables, clean variables, and type

## File Size
```{r compute_size, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
sizes <- sizedf %>% dplyr::group_by(type) %>% dplyr::summarise(sum(size))
orig_size <- round(sizes[1, 2]/1000, 1)
clean_size <- round(sizes[2, 2]/1000, 1)
percent <- round((orig_size-clean_size)/orig_size*100, 0)
```


`nsqipr` significantly reduces file sizes after cleaning the data. The cumulative file size for the entire NSQIP database (not including targeted procedures) is reduced from `r orig_size` GB to `r clean_size` GB (a `r percent`% decrease).

```{r file_size}
sizedf %>%
  ggplot2::ggplot(ggplot2::aes(x = name, y = size, fill = type)) +
  ggplot2::geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = ggplot2::position_dodge()) +
  ggplot2::scale_fill_brewer(palette="Paired", labels = c("Before", "After")) +
  ggplot2::coord_flip() +
  ggplot2::labs(y = "File size (MB)") +
  ggplot2::theme_minimal() +
  ggplot2::theme(axis.title.y = ggplot2::element_blank(),
                 legend.title = ggplot2::element_blank())
```

## Cleaning Time

Compared to manually cleaning and combining data, `nsqipr` is blazing fast. The largest single file, `r mb$expr[which(mb$time == max(mb$time))]`, takes only `r max(mb$time)` seconds to clean. The entire NSQIP database (not including targeted procedures) can be cleaned and combined in only `r round(sum(mb$time)/60, 1)` minutes.

```{r clean_time}
mb %>%
  ggplot2::ggplot(ggplot2::aes(x = expr, y = time)) +
  ggplot2::geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#56B4E9") +
  ggplot2::coord_flip() +
  ggplot2::labs(y = "Cleaning time (sec)") +
  ggplot2::theme_minimal() +
  ggplot2::theme(axis.title.y = ggplot2::element_blank(),
                 legend.title = ggplot2::element_blank())
```
