\description{
Parse a column for type of fistula
}
\details{
NSQIP encodes the \code{pan_fistula} column as either a biochemica leak, a clinical diagnosis,
persistent drainage, or a grade B or C POPF. This function extracts those values from character vectors
and factors them.
}
\examples{
fistulas <- c("No", "Yes-persistent drainage, drain continued >7 days",
"Yes-clinical diagnosis, drain continued >7 days", "Yes-persistent drainage, percutaneous drainage performed",
"Yes-clinical diagnosis, percutaneous drainage performed", "Yes-persistent drainage, reoperation performed",
"Unknown", "Yes-clinical diagnosis, reoperation performed", "Yes-clinical diagnosis, spontaneous wound drainage",
"Yes-persistent drainage, NPO-TPN", "Yes-clinical diagnosis, NPO-TPN", "No evidence of Biochemical Leak or POPF",
"Biochemical Leak only", "Yes, Grade B POPF present", "Yes, Grade C POPF present")
