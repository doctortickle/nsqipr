\details{
2005-2007 NSQIP PUFs included a race called "Asian or Pacific islander". Later PUFs split these into "Asian" and
"Native Hawaiian or Pacific islander". In order to combine PUFs, a decision must be made as to which group to assign
"Asian or Pacific islander" to. To assign them to "Asian", \code{pacific} should be set to "asian". To assign them to
"Native Hawaiian or Pacific islander", \code{pacific} should be set to "hawaiian".
